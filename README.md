🌊 AI-Based Flood Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

Floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters, leading to severe loss of life, property damage, and economic setbacks. Traditional prediction methods are often delayed and inaccurate.

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze climate and hydrological data such as rainfall, river water levels, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. The model predicts flood risks in advance, helping authorities take preventive measures and enabling better disaster management.

🚨 Problem Statement

Floods cause severe loss of life and property, and traditional prediction methods are often inaccurate and delayed.

🎯 Description

This project uses AI and ML algorithms to:

Process rainfall, river level, and climate data.

Train predictive models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).

Predict the probability of a flood event.

Categorize risk levels as Low, Medium, or High.
